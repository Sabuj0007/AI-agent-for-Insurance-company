2. Motor Insurance

What Motor Insurance is:

Motor insurance gives protection to the vehicle
owner against (I). damages to his/her vehicle and
(ii). pays for any Third Party Liability determined as
per law against the owner of the vehicle. Third Party
Insurance is a statutory requirement. The owner of
the vehicle is legally liable for any injury or damage
to third party life or property caused by or arising out
of the use of the vehicle in a public place. Driving a
motor vehicle without insurance in a public place is
a punishable offence in terms of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988.

Types of Motor Insurance cover:

Broadly there are two types of insurances policies
that offer motor insurance cover:
a. Liability Only Policy (Statutory requirement)
b. Package Policy (Liability Only Policy + Damage
to owner's Vehicle usually called O.D Cover)
Remember that if you take only a Liability Only
Policy, damage to your vehicle will not be covered.
Hence, it would be prudent to take a Package Policy
which would give a wider cover, including cover for
your vehicle.

What Motor Insurance covers:

The damages to the vehicle due to the following
perils are usually covered under OD section of the
Motor Insurance policy:
a. Fire, Explosion, Self- Ignition, Lightning
b. Burglary/Housebreaking / Theft
c. Riot & Strike
d. Earthquake
e. Flood, Storm, Cyclone, Hurricane, tempest,
inundation, hailstorm, frost
f. Accidental external means
g. Malicious Act
h. Terrorism acts
i. While in Transit by Rail/ Road, Inland
waterways, Lift, Elevator or Air
j. Land slide / Rock slide

What Motor Insurance excludes:

The following contingencies are usually excluded
under the Motor Insurance Policy:
Not having a valid Driving License
Under Influence of intoxicating liquor/ drugs
Accident taking place beyond Geographical limits
While Vehicle is used for unlawful purposes
Electrical/Mechanical Breakdowns.

Basis of Sum Insured:

For Own Damage:
The Sum Insured under a Motor Insurance policy
reflects the value of the motor vehicle determined
based on the concept known as Insured's Declared
Value. Insured's Declared Value is the value arrived at
based on the Manufacturer's present value and
depreciation based on the Age of the Vehicle.
For Third Party:
Coverage is as per requirements of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988 . Compulsory Personal accident cover for
owner-driver is also included. Policy can also be
extended to cover various other risks like Personal
Accident to occupants of vehicle, Workmen's
Compensation to Driver, etc over and above the cover
available to him under statute.

3. FAQs on Motor Insurance

Q. What Motor Insurance cover should I buy?
Should I buy Comprehensive Insurance or
Liability only Policy ?

Ans. Third Party Liability insurance is mandatory for
all vehicles plying on public roads in India. This
covers Liability for injuries and damages to
others that you are responsible for. In addition, it
is prudent to cover loss or damages to the vehicle
itself by way of Comprehensive/Package policy,
which covers both "Liability" as well as "Own
damage" to Insured vehicle. Liability Only cover
is also known as Act Only cover.

Q. How is the premium determined?

Ans. Many factors determine the premium you will
pay. For Own Damage cover different insurance
companies charge different premiums for similar
coverage. Shop around; getting three or more
comparison quotes is worthwhile. Check various
insurers's websites; it will help you compare
premiums. Do not forget to compare deductibles,
coverage and IDV's as premium may be lesser of
one insurer but with higher deductibles, lower
coverage and lower IDV, which will adversely
impact you in the event of claim settlement.
Be prepared to give your agent information about
the following items that are commonly used to
determine your premium: Vehicle registration
details with Engine No., Chasis no., Class of
vehicle, cubic capacity, seating capacity, etc. (In
fact, all relevant details are in the RC book/card
and a copy of same may be handed over) Tax paid
details; Certificate of fitness, Driver details - age,
gender, qualifications, licence validity Previous
insurance history, if any.
The Own Damage coverage is left to be rated by
individual insurance companies after duly filing
rates with the Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority. The same is
determined on following factors amongst others
-- Age of vehicle; Discounts / loadings-
Appropriate Bonus / loading/ discounts along
with past claims experience are taken into
account while calculating premium. IDV
(Insured Declared Value).
Third Party Liability Premium rates are laid
down by IRDA.
In case of break in insurance, vehicle inspection
would be required and extra charges will have to
be incurred for the same.

Q. What coverage limits meet my needs?

Ans. For Own Damage, the Sum Insured for the
vehicle is called "Insured Declared Value" and
should reflect the current market value of the
vehicle. For Third Party Liability cover, there is
unlimited coverage to Third parties injuries,
however, Third party property damages are
covered up to a sum of Rs.750,000. Insured has
option to restrict coverage for Third Party
Property damage to Rs.6,000 whereby there will
be reduction in "Liability Only" premium.

Q. What is the period of the policy?

Ans. The policy is usually valid for a period of one year
and has to be renewed before the due date. Pay
the premium on time. No Insurer offers a grace
period for paying the premium - the due date is
the due date. In case of lapse of policy by even
one day, the vehicle has to be inspected.
Moreover, if a comprehensive policy is allowed to
lapse for more than 90 days, the accrued benefit
of NCB (No Claim Bonus) is also lost.

Q. What is "No Claim Bonus"?

Ans. No Claim Bonus (NCB) is the benefit accrued to
an insured for NIL claims during the previous
policy period. As per current norms prevalent, it
ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium
(and not on Liability premium) and progressively
increases to a maximum of 50% based on
successive claim free years. If, however, a claim is
lodged, the No claim Bonus is lost in the
subsequent policy period. NCB is given to
insured and not to the insured vehicle. Hence,
on transfer of the vehicle, the insurance policy
can be transferred to new owner but not the
NCB. The new owner has to pay the difference
on account of NCB for the balance policy period.
The original owner can, however, use the NCB
on a new vehicle purchased by him provided he
has not transferred the insurance to the buyer of
old car. Insurance Co has to be intimated
immediately (in any case not later than the time
limit prescribed) about sale of his old vehicle and
his intention to retain the insurance. Original
certificate of Insurance is to be surrendered to
Insurance Co. within 3 years period, as and when
the Insured buys a new car, it will be substituted
in the old insurance policy till its validity period.
Pro-rata difference of premium on account of
increase in IDV of new vehicle is to be paid.

Q. Will my No Claim Bonus get migrated if I want
to change my insurance company?

Ans. Yes, you can avail of the NCB facility if you
change the insurer on renewal. You would have
to produce proof of the NCB earned by way of
renewal notice from the current insurer. If the
same cannot be produced, you may produce your
original expiring policy along with a certification
that no claim has been lodged by yourself on the
expiring policy. Hence, evidence can be in form
of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the
NCB entitlement from the previous insurer.

Q. Are there discounts that will lower my
premium?

Ans. In addition to NCB, there are additional
discounts available under Own Damage
Premium for membership of Automobile
Association of India, Vintage Cars (Pvt. Cars
certified by the Vintage and Classic Car Club of
India); Installation of anti-theft devices
approved by Automobile Research Association
of India (ARAI), Pune and whose installation is
approved by AAI; Concessions for specially
designed/modified vehicles for the Blind,
Handicapped and mentally challenged persons,
which are suitably endorsed in the RC by the
RTA concerned; - opting for voluntary
additional deductible/excess.
Under "Liability Only Section", discounts are
available for reduction in Third Party Property
Damage
(TPPD) from Rs. 750,000 to Rs. 6,000.

Q. Is Service Tax is applicable and how much is it?

Ans. Yes , Service Tax is applicable and would be as
per prevailing rule of law.

Q. What is deductible?

Ans. Deductible or "excess" is the amount over and
above, which the claim will be payable. There is a
normal standard/compulsory excess for most
vehicles ranging from Rs. 50 for two-wheelers to
Rs. 500 for Pvt. Cars and Commercial vehicles
which increases depending upon the cubic
capacity/carrying capacity of the vehicle.
However, in some cases the insurer may impose
additional excess depending upon the age of the
vehicle or if there is high frequency of claims.

Q. What is the procedure for recording any
changes in the policy?

Ans. If there are any changes in the policy, it will be
done by an Endorsement by the insurance office.
Submit a letter to the insurer with proof for the
changes and obtain the Endorsement. Check the
correctness of the Endorsement.

Q. If I am using the car in a particular city, what
premium rate is applied?

Ans. For the purpose of applying premium rate, the
place where the vehicle is registered is reckoned
(Not the place where the vehicle is used). If your
vehicle is registered in Chennai rate applicable
for Zone A is charged. Even when you shift to a
different city / town, the same rate will continue
to be applied. Similarly if a vehicle is registered in
a town, it attracts Zone B premium rate.
Subsequently if the owner shifts to a metro, he
will continue to be charged Zone B rate.

Q. What is a Certificate of Insurance under
Motor Vehicle Act?

Ans. As per Rule 141 of Central Motor Vehicle Rules
1989, a certificate of Insurance is to be issued
only in Form 51. It is only in Motor Vehicle
Insurance, apart from policy, a separate
certificate of insurance is required to be issued by
Insurers as per law. This document should always
be carried in the vehicle. Policy should be
preserved separately at home / office.

Q. If I fit CNG or LPG kit to my vehicle, is it
necessary to inform the Insurance Company?

Ans. If CNG / LPG kit is fitted to the vehicle, RTA
where the vehicle was registered should be

certificate (RC). The Insurance Company
should also be informed to have the kit covered
on payment of extra premium on the value of the
kit under "OD" section and also under "TP"
section.

vehicle while plying in public places?

writing of such transfer to the insurance
company. A fresh proposal form needs to be filled
in. There is a nominal fee charged for transfer of
insurance along with pro-rata recovery of NCB
from the date of transfer till policy expiry. It may
be noted that transfer of ownership in
comprehensive/package policies has to be
recorded within 14 days from date of transfer
failing which no claim will be payable for own
damages to the vehicle.

Q. Can I continue the insurance in the name of
the previous owner even after the vehicle is
transferred in RTO records in my name?
Ans. No. Registration and insurance of the vehicle
should always be in the same name with same
address. Otherwise the claim is not payable. A
fresh proposal form needs to be filled in. There is
a nominal fee charged for transfer of insurance.

duplicate one?

Ans. Yes, please approach the same office, which had
issued the policy, with a written request. A
nominal fee is charged for issuing duplicate
policy copy.
